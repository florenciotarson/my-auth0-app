# My Auth0-Enabled React App

A simple **React** application demonstrating how to integrate **Auth0** for user authentication using a custom domain.

## Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It incorporates the [Auth0 React SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react) to handle user authentication via a custom Auth0 domain.

## Key Features

- **Auth0 Authentication**: Includes login, logout, and protected user profile data.
- **Custom Domain**: Configured to use a custom Auth0 domain (`auth.oxecollective.com`).
- **React Hooks**: Uses the `useAuth0` hook to manage auth state (loading, authenticated user details).
- **Create React App**: Eases development with automatic build scripts and development server.

### Notable Files

- **`auth_config.json`**  
  Holds Auth0 domain (`auth.oxecollective.com`) and your client ID.  
  ```json
  {
    "domain": "auth.oxecollective.com",
    "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
  }
  ```

- **`index.js`**  
  Wraps the entire application with the `Auth0Provider`, providing authentication context to the rest of the app.

- **`App.js`**  
  Demonstrates how to use `useAuth0` for login, logout, and displaying user info.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git
   cd <REPO_NAME>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # or using Yarn
   yarn
   ```

3. **Configure Auth0**:  
   - Open `src/auth_config.json` and update:
     ```json
     {
       "domain": "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN_OR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN",
       "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
     }
     ```
   - In your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/), ensure your **Allowed Callback URLs**, **Allowed Logout URLs**, and **Allowed Web Origins** include:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000
     ```

4. **Run locally**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.  

5. **Log in**:
   - Click **Log In** to be redirected to the Auth0 login page (served from your custom domain if configured).
   - After a successful login, you’ll be returned to the app and see user profile data.

## Deployment

To deploy, you can use services like **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **GitHub Pages**. Be sure to:

- Add your production URL(s) to your Auth0 Dashboard’s **Allowed Callback**, **Logout**, and **Web Origins** fields.
- Adjust any environment variables or build settings needed by your hosting provider.
